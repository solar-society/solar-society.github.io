	The Solar Society of Pohang is a forum for inquisitive minds from all walks of life â€“ scientists, engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, ethicists, philosophers, and more. We believe that by bringing together diverse perspectives, we can spark new ideas, foster collaboration, and address the complex challenges facing our world today.

	Inspired by historical societies like the Lunar Society of Birmingham, we aim to cultivate an environment of intellectual curiosity and open dialogue.  We are particularly interested in exploring the transformative potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on various aspects of human life, from industry and economy to art and ethics.

	Our meetings feature engaging presentations, lively discussions, and interactive workshops, providing a platform for members to share their knowledge, learn from others, and contribute to a brighter future.
