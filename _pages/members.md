Gunsun is a Professor of the Department of Physcis of POSTECH.
He is a distinguished researcher specializing in plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
He earned his Ph.D. (2008) and M.S. (2004) in plasma physics from the California Institute of Technology and a B.S. (1998) from POSTECH.
His research focuses on high-pressure plasma source technologies,
strongly coupled plasma systems under extreme conditions, plasma-surface interactions, and MHD phenomena.

His major research contributions include developing 2D microwave imaging diagnostics,
discovering dynamic equilibria and phase transitions of MHD modes in fusion plasma,
identifying a universal colliation mechanism for current-carrying flux tubes,
and
extending the gas breakdown law to high-frequency, high-pressure conditions.
