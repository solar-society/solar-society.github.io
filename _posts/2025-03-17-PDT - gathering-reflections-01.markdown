# Session Highlights

## Opening Address

The welcoming remarks by Sunghee and Gunsu established the philosophical foundation of our society, drawing parallels to the historical Lunar Society of Birmingham while emphasizing our unique focus on emerging technologies in the Asian context.

> "Just as the Lunar Society gathered during the full moon, we come together as the sun rises over the eastern coast of Korea, symbolizing new beginnings and illumination through shared knowledge."

## Interactive Discussion

The open forum generated several promising interdisciplinary project proposals:

- A collaborative research initiative on AI applications in sustainable energy
- A public lecture series to engage the broader community in technological discourse
- An residency program connecting technologists with creative practitioners
- An AI ethics working group to develop guidelines relevant to Korean context

# Looking Forward

Based on enthusiastic participant feedback,
we proposed bi-annual meetings.
The next formal gathering is tentatively scheduled for some time around Winter, 2025,
and the venue (of course) should be Pohang this time!

## Action Items

- Formalize working group membership and objectives by April 1st
- Establish online collaboration platform for ongoing dialogue
- Develop criteria for new member nominations
<!-- - Begin planning for public lecture series to launch in May -->

# Acknowledgements

Special thanks to all participants for their valuable contributions, and particularly to our hosts at 511 Tower for providing an excellent venue for our discussions.

We look forward to continuing this journey of discovery and collaboration as the Solar Society of Pohang grows.
