<h1 id="about-us">
About Us
</h1>

<!--p>
	The Solar Society of Pohang is a forum for inquisitive minds from all walks of life – scientists, engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, ethicists, philosophers, and more. We believe that by bringing together diverse perspectives, we can spark new ideas, foster collaboration, and address the complex challenges facing our world today.
</p-->

<p>
	<strong>Imagine a place where a neuroscientist, opera singer, AI researcher, environmental lawyer, and quantum physicist sit down together to solve humanity's biggest challenges.</strong> That's the <a href="/">Solar Society of Pohang</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>We're proud of what we're building:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>True interdisciplinary exchange</strong> — From Stanford to POSTECH, from Seoul to Silicon Valley, from research labs to concert halls</li>
	<li><strong>No barriers to entry</strong> — Your passion and kindness matter more than your degrees</li>
	<li><strong>Global cultural embrace</strong> — We welcome virtually any culture, as long as they honor humanity</li>
	<li><strong>37.5% women and growing</strong> — We're actively working toward 50% or higher because gender balance isn't just a goal, it's a commitment we take seriously</li>
</ul>

<!--p>
	Inspired by historical societies like
	the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society_of_Birmingham">Lunar Society of Birmingham</a>,
	we aim to cultivate an environment of intellectual curiosity and open dialogue.
	We are particularly interested in exploring the transformative potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on various aspects of human life,
	from industry and economy to art and ethics.
</p-->

<p>
	Inspired by historical societies like
	the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society_of_Birmingham" target="_blank">Lunar Society of Birmingham</a> (which sparked the Industrial Revolution through interdisciplinary dialogue),
	we're building something transformative for the AI age.
	Just as the Lunar Society gathered during the full moon, <strong>we convene as the sun rises over Korea's eastern coast</strong>—symbolizing new beginnings and illumination through shared knowledge.
</p>

<!--p>
	Our meetings feature engaging presentations, lively discussions, and interactive workshops, providing a platform for members to share their knowledge, learn from others, and contribute to a brighter future.
</p-->

<p>
	We are particularly interested in exploring the transformative potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on various aspects of human life—from climate change and healthcare to ethics and education, from industry innovation to cultural preservation. Our focus isn't just on technology itself, but on how emerging innovations can truly benefit society while staying grounded in humanities and ethics.
</p>

<h1 id="vision">Our Vision</h1>

<p>
	<strong>We envision a future where:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Technology serves humanity, not the other way around</li>
	<li>Diverse voices shape how innovation develops and is deployed</li>
	<li>Scientists and artists collaborate to solve complex problems</li>
	<li>Ethics and efficiency go hand in hand</li>
	<li>No one is left behind in the technological transformation</li>
	<li>Cultural diversity enriches rather than complicates progress</li>
	<li>Curiosity and kindness drive decision-making</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<strong>This isn't just idealism—it's necessity.</strong> The challenges we face (climate change, healthcare crises, AI ethics, social inequality) are too complex for any single discipline to solve alone. We need the physicist's rigor, the artist's creativity, the lawyer's precision, the philosopher's wisdom, and the engineer's pragmatism—all working together.

<h1 id="mission">Our Mission</h1>

The Solar Society of Pohang brings together diverse experts to foster innovation and address contemporary challenges, with a focus on how emerging technologies can benefit society.

<h2 id="sun-rising-alliance">
	Sun Rising Alliance
</h2>

The South Korean coastal cities of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulsan">Ulsan</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohang">Pohang</a>,
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongju">Gyeongju</a>,
located along the eastern seaboard,
have established the "<a href="https://youtu.be/u-n54Uh1BzY?si=WgaxXA3sMG8BL0r4">Sun Rising Alliance</a>."
This collaborative initiative aptly reflects the name of our society, given these cities' strategic position to greet the dawn.
